### 🧠 About Me

I am a learner in the <strong>ALX Backend Web Development Program</strong> and I’m currently sharpening my skills to build scalable, real-world solutions that empower communities and solve meaningful problems.  

💡 I started software engineering because I wanted to stop **dreaming about solutions** and start **building them**.  
💬 I’m deeply passionate about <strong>problem-solving, design, and creating tech that impacts lives</strong>.  
✨ I love building beautiful, functional systems—and believe that tech is the bridge between <strong>ideas and transformation</strong>.

### 🎯 My Vision

My aim is to become a <strong>Fullstack Engineer and Serial Startup Founder</strong>—building ventures like <strong>Kenten</strong> that address systemic problems in Ghana and across Africa.  
I believe in using technology to make access, affordability, and impact scale sustainably.
